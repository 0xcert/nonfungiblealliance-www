In a few days, 0xcert team will be attending the **NIFTY Conference in Hong Kong**, along with some of the biggest players in the non-fungible space.

The **3-day event** will be co-hosted by Kenetic and Decentraland, and co-organized by CryptoKitties. 0xcert is supporting the conference as a Sponsor.

## Topic and focus
The aim of the NIFTY conference is to bring together developers, entrepreneurs, and investors to elaborate on the **future of non-fungible tokens (NFTs)**, collectibles, and the potential of blockchainizing the uniqueness of assets. With joined forces, NIFTY is building on expanding the consumer market and the community that is employing blockchain technology.

The core of the conference discussion will be **non-fungibility**, a recent advancement in blockchain technology, and its application in the widest sense possible: from NFTs in crypto games, through tokens standards on different platforms and NFT economy, to building secure dapps and hosting ERC-721 metadata workshop.

## Among the best

Among the speakers at NIFTY, several renowned names will be representing  various industry giants, such as HTC, DAPP.com, MadHive, Decentraland, Coinbase, Kenetic, GameToken, 0x Project, Codex Protocol, RareBits, Ethereum Foundation, Neon District, and others.

0xcert will have its say, too, with our **top advisor, William Entriken, the main author of the ERC-721 standard**, presenting the future of the NFTs on [July 25, 9:45AM local time](<https://www.nifty.gg/agenda/session/263574>). 

Also, **0xcert's CEO, Jure Zih**, will be joining the panel discussion about [NFT extensibility and interoperability](<https://www.nifty.gg/agenda/session/263650>), on July 26, at 3PM local time.
