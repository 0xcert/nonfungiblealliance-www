## Deployment

Run `npm run deploy:staging` and `npm run deploy:production` to deploy to
staging and production, respectively. Note that this will deploy the code
that you currently have in your working directory.

## Infrastructure

### Create Infra

#### Set up secrets

1. Copy the example secrets file: `cp infra/cf/infra-params-secrets-example.json infra/cf/infra-params-secrets.json`.
2. Edit the file `infra/cf/infra-params-secrets.json` and put in your secrets where needed.

#### Provision infrastructure

```bash
STACK_NAME=nonfungiblealliance-www
aws cloudformation deploy --template-file infra/cf/infra.yml --stack-name $STACK_NAME --parameter-overrides file://./infra/cf/infra-params-secrets.json --capabilities CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM
```

#### Delete the entire infrastructure

**Warning:** this will wipe out the entire infrastructure for this app,
so be sure this is what you wat to do.

```bash
STACK_NAME=nonfungiblealliance-www
aws cloudformation delete-stack --stack-name $STACK_NAME
```
