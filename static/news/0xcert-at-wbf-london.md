After a few weeks of 0xcertifying in our homeland, it's time for us to pack the bags and board the plane again, this time to attend the upcoming edition of Keynote's **[World Blockchain Forum](https://london.keynote.ae/)**.

## Why WBF?
World Blockchain Forum is one of the leading global blockchain events, hosting cherry-picked industry leaders and attracting a wide array of blockchain and crypto enthusiasts.
The event is organized by Keynote, a world top blockchain consultancy organization, and we are happy to have their CEO, **Dr. Moe Levin**, as Advisor to 0xcert. In the light of our mutual promotional activities, we were invited to attend the London star-studded conference, the third WBF for 0xcert after the [New York edition](https://0xcert.org/news/roadshow-wbf-cogx) in June and Dubai in April. Having had a great and productive time at previous WBFs and seeing it coming to a city so close to us, it was only a matter of moment before we confirmed the RSVP.

## 0xcert agenda
Acknowledging not only the importance of such events for the promotion of new projects and technology advancements but also the power of networking and dialogue with other industry leaders, 0xcert is partaking in the forum as a **proud sponsor to the WBF activities**.
Supporting the forum's agenda of redefining financial, social, and economic landscapes, we believe that non-fungibility on the blockchain is a dimension that could find its place in all of the above spectrums and further.

0xcert team - **CSO Urban Osvald and Marketing Manager Petra Kosi** - will be there to discuss Protocol- and NFT-related topics with all the curious souls. Make sure you stop by the 0xcert booth, as we have prepared something special for the visitors of our non-fungible corner - not counting the insights on the next big thing in the blockchain...

So if you're in London the first week of September, we'll be happy to meet you at our WBF 0xcert booth to talk about the Protocol, NFTs, ERC721, and everything in between and beyond. The WBF will be taking place at the historical landmark on the North Bank of the River Thames, **the Old Billingsgate, between September 3-5**.

Get your dose of breathtaking London views and ahead-of-our-time blockchain insights. We'll see you there!
