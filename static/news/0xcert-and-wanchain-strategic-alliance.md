0xcert, the first open protocol supporting the future of unique digital assets, and Wanchain, the distributed financial infrastructure using cross-blockchain smart contracts with privacy protection, **announced today a strategic alliance for the implementation of the non-fungible tokens standard on Wanchain.**

## New milestone

0xcert is proudly announcing that a strategic alliance with Wanchain, the distributed financial infrastructure based on cross-blockchain smart contracts, has been officially formed.

This is an important milestone in 0xcert's path towards a global and cross-industry adoption of non-fungible tokens.

After having just recently conducted and finished the [first ever ICO with ERC-721 tokens used in the KYC procedure](/news/crowdsale-recap), 0xcert is now on it's way to bring the power of unique assets to one of the leaders in blockchain infrastructures, **Wanchain.**

## Goals and usability

**The alliance was built with the goal of providing developers an additional blockchain infrastructure option, along with cross-chain functionality and improved privacy component.**

After the last-year craze around CryptoKitties marking the beginning of non-fungible tokens, the [ERC-721 standard](/news/erc721-confirmed-final) has just recently been officially confirmed, proving the importance of non-fungible direction the blockchain world is heading towards.

0xcert is among the first project striving to provide a complete framework for developers to build decentralized apps. Through those, unique assets, such as real-estate properties, artwork, or collectibles, can be digitally represented, tokenized, and verified. 

Through Wanchain, 0xcert protocol will also be running on Wan network, leveraging also its improved privacy and cross-chain features.

In words of 0xcert CEO **Jure Zih**,

> "Wanchain is definitely one of the best strategic and technological decisions we have made. With private transactions enabled, a whole field of opportunities and implementations arise in what to build on NFTs. Also, imagine owning a very rare and expensive NFT token and having the ability to send it cross-chain. This alliance  makes so much sense and we’re all looking forward to working together."

## Combined power

One of the main advantages for both 0xcert and Wanchain is enabling exchange of digital assets, providing security, privacy and a verification standard for everyone involved.

Besides, blockchain ecosystem will be improved by the infrastructure provided by 0xcert and Wanchain, which will empower blockchain startups as well as traditional organizations.

> “At Wanchain, we have always strived to be one step ahead of the game and we are optimistic about the non-fungible token standard in the future. There’s so much one could do with the right toolset, and we’re really happy to see 0xcert has embarked on this journey - now with an extensive focus on Wanchain,” 

said **Jack Lu**, Founder of Wanchain.

**Kristijan Sedlak**, Co-founder and CTO of 0xcert, added: 

> “Focusing on our solution - an open-source protocol that strives to be community-driven for managing non-fungible tokens on the blockchain - will through partnering with Wanchain broaden the use of non-fungible tokens. It will be exciting to see how this new category will be used and how it will soon create completely new experiences.”
