[**Delta Summit Malta**](https://delta-summit.com/) is one of the most significant events in the fall/winter period in Europe, as it brings together the greatest thinkers and doers in blockchain, tech, and business.

Needless to say, 0xcert is going to show up, too.

## It's going to be packed
The Delta Summit will take place between **October 3-5**, with over [**40 discussion panels**](https://delta-summit.com/agenda/) lining up. The agenda will combine a diverse palette of experts from all geo zones, representing an array of organizations and opinions. Surely something not to be missed.

## So how to meet us there?
0xcert will not be present at a dedicated booth on your Delta Summit floor map, because this time we chose to go out and around to meet and talk to as many people as possible. And we'll do our best to spread non-fungibility to all corners of the [IAAC Conference Centre](https://delta-summit.com/venue/).

Still, if you'd like to meet us while we're in Malta without having to look for us all around the place, do **drop us a line at hello@0xcert.org** and we'll get back in touch. The more info you provide us, the easier will be for us to take time and place just for you.

## What's next in October?
Right after the Delta Summit closes its doors, we'll be packing our bags for our next destinations on the **0xcert October Roadshow**. New locations of blockchain and tech events keep popping up, and we'll do our best to show up at most of them, so stay tuned for updates.

But first - **Delta Summit, Malta**.
