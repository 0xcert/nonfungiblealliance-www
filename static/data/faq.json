    "answer": "The most common tokens of today's crypto economy follow the Ethereum's\nERC-20 specification. These tokens carry a price, which can be divided into\nsmaller amounts. One can exchange just a portion of that price for a service or\nfor different tokens. This is called fungibility, thus these are called fungible\nTokens. Recently, another kind of token called non-fungible tokens started getting attention in the crypto community. It all started with Cryptokitties - tradable collectibles - which set the foundation for the now accepted ERC-721 standard. Unlike ERC-20 identical tokens, which carry a price, non-fungible tokens are unique and carry some sort of data."
